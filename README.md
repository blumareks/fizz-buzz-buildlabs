# fizz-buzz-buildlabs
an example kata for build labs: 

 - Use `npm install` to download required libraries;
 - Start an app by issuing `node app.js`;
 - Make notice of the port: `Example app listening on port 3000` - here `3000`;
 - in a browser type `http://localhost:3000/number/5` to get the response in JSON;
 
 Enjoy!
